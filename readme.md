## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first project attempting Mobile-first workflow.
I learned how to change the product image from the mobile img provided to the desktop img using a src set, and then setting the media querie on that so it changes from one image to the other.

### Continued development

I really want to continue learning grid and media queries aswell as making my projects responsive using the mobile-first approach .
